	<p class="text-text-secondary dark:text-text-primary-dark leading-5 mb-4">Mange-Me is a robust project management system designed to streamline
		and
		enhance team collaboration and project
		tracking, much like Jira. Built using modern technologies such as Svelte for the frontend, TypeScript for type
		safety, Node.js for server-side operations, and MongoDB for scalable database management, Mange-Me offers a seamless
		and efficient user experience.
	</p>
	<p class="text-text-secondary dark:text-text-primary-dark  leading-5 mb-4">At its core, Mange-Me provides a comprehensive suite of tools for
		managing
		projects, tasks, and workflows. Users can create and organize projects, assign tasks to team members, set deadlines,
		and track progress in real-time. The intuitive Svelte-based user interface ensures a responsive and dynamic
		experience, making it easy for teams to navigate through their projects and tasks with minimal friction.
	</p>
	<p class="text-text-secondary dark:text-text-primary-dark  leading-5">The use of TypeScript adds a layer of reliability and maintainability to the
		system, catching errors early in the
		development process and ensuring a more robust codebase. On the backend, Node.js enables high performance and
		scalability, capable of handling numerous simultaneous requests without compromising speed or efficiency. MongoDB,
		with its flexible schema design, allows for efficient storage and retrieval of project data, accommodating the
		varying needs of different projects and teams.
